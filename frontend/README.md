# Getting Started with Vite + React

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and has been migrated to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for improved performance.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload when you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

**Performance**: Vite typically starts in under 1 second compared to the previous 60+ second startup time with Create React App.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner using Vitest.\
Tests run in watch mode by default. Use `npm test -- --run` for a single test run.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run preview`

Locally preview the production build using Vite's preview server.
